a. The only equivalent to [3,5,3] from the list was 5: "3:(5:(3:[]))"
b.
	1. The operation is not legal as it is an attempt to prepend a character with a list of characters
	2. The operation is legal
	3. The operation is legal
	4. The operation is not legal because the ":" operator dictates the first is an element and the second is a list, both are the same type in this example.
	5. The operation is legal
	6. The operation is not legal as 1 is an integer and not a string
c. Generates "([3,4,7,5,8],[3,4,7,5,8])". back is assigned all elements except the first, while front is assigned the first element. The tuple is then generated in (1st, front:back). 1st obviously is the passed in list whereas front:back is just the tail prepended with the head (or the same list)
